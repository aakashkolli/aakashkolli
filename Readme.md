# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, built with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.

### Credits

This project was built using the [Personal](https://bootstrapmade.com/personal-free-resume-bootstrap-template/) free resume template by [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/). The initial structure I adapted was from the portfolio of [Prerak Raja](https://github.com/rajaprerak).
